# Hostelez
A window-based application that aims at making hostel life less troublesome by managing hostel-related complaints in a less arduous and more reliable way.

## Tech Used:
• UI: Swing  and Awt
• Database: Arrays and ArrayList

## About
Our project has two sides - 
•	the user end, and 
•	the admin end.

The **user end** is for the students, which allows them to lodge complaints, view the status of the complaint, and see the complaint’s history. 
Whereas, on the **admin end**, the management authority can view the lodged complaints and can update the status of the complaint.
