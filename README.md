# Hostelez
A window-based application that aims at making hostel life less troublesome by managing hostel-related complaints in a less arduous and more reliable way using C++.

### About
Our project has two sides 
-	the user end, and 
-	the admin end.


The **user end** is for the students, which allows them to lodge complaints, view the status of the complaint, and see the complaintâ€™s history. 
Whereas, on the **admin end**, the management authority can view the lodged complaints and can update the status of the complaint.

### Tech Used:
- UI: Swing  and Awt
- Database: Arrays and ArrayList
